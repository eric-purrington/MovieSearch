# Cinema Seeker
A React Native application built to make your next cozy movie night amazing. 


## Description

A phone app that provides users with the ability to search the [Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Includes redux storage (little overkill) to find previously viewed movies.

## Preparing the App

- Initialize the project using ```npm install```
- iOS - run ```cd ios && pod install``` to get pods (cocoapods required - follow download instructions here [here](https://cocoapods.org/))
- Add .env to root of project. Local .env should contain proper credentials from .env.sample in order to run successfully. 

## Running the App

- iOS - run ```npx react-native start``` to start metro server. In new terminal window, on the project root, run ```npx react-native run-ios```
- Android - run ```npx react-native start``` to start metro server. In new terminal window, on the project root, run ```npx react-native run-android```
